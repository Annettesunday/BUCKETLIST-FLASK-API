## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

1. Python 2.7
Comes inbuilt for unix but can also be downloaded from
[Python downloads](https://www.python.org/downloads/)

### Installing

Clone this repo from github by running:
with ssh:
```
$ git clone git@github.com: Annettesunday/BUCKETLIST-FLASK-API
```

with http:
```
$ git clone https://github.com/Annettesunday/BUCKETLIST-FLASK-API.git
```

Set up a virtual environment for the project and install the dependencies

```
$ mkvirtualenv venv
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
```
### Running the project locally
Create a `.env` file in the root directory and save it. It should contain your secret key stored under the variable `SECRET_KEY` which will be used to secure your data.

Create miration folder

```
$ python manage.py db init
```

Migrate data to the database

```
$ python manage.py db migrate
```

Upgrade

```
$ python manage.py runserver
```

Once the server is running the API is accessible on localhost and uses port 5000.

#### URL endpoints

The following endpoints are provided 

|URL Endpoint| HTTP Methods | Summary |
| -------- | ------------- | --------- |
| `/auth/register` | `POST`  | Register a new user|
|  `/auth/login` | `POST` | Login and retrieve token|
| `/bucketlist` | `POST` | Create a new Bucketlist |
| `/bucketlist` | `GET` | Retrieve all bucketlists for user |
| `/bucketlist/?q=bucket` | `GET` | Match bucketlist by name |
| `/bucketlist/<id>` | `GET` |  Retrieve bucket list details |
| `/bucketlist/<id>` | `PUT` | Update bucket list details |
| `/bucketlist/<id>` | `DELETE` | Delete a bucket list |
| `/bucketlist/<id>/items` | `POST` |  Create items in a bucket list |
| `/bucketlist/<id>/items/<item_ID>` | `DELETE`| Delete a item in a bucket list|
| `/bucketlist/<id>/items/<item_ID>` | `PUT`| update a bucket list item details|



## Running the tests

 They can be run by the command

```
python manage.py test
```

The tests make use of HTTP response codes to ensure users are getting the expected responses from the api as well as token based authentication which ensures security of users data by ensuring only authorised users gain access to sensitive data.
